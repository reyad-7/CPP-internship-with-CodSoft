# Internship Tasks - Simple Console Programs

Welcome to my internship tasks repository, where I've completed a series of simple console programs using Python. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each task along with links to their respective code repositories:

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game
In this task, I created a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

## Task 2: Simple Calculator
I developed a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

## Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
For this task, I built a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other. The game features:
- A 3x3 grid as the game board.
- Players assigned as "X" and "O."
- Display of the current state of the board.
- Prompting of the current player to enter their move.
- Updating of the game board with the player's move.
- Checking for a win or draw.
- Alternating turns between "X" and "O" players.
- Displaying the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).
- An option to play another game.

## Task 4: To-Do List
In this task, I built a simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. The program includes features such as:
- Task input for users to add tasks to the list.
- Task addition functionality.
- Task viewing with status (completed or pending).
- Marking tasks as completed.
- Removing tasks from the list.
